# PREDICTO
PREDICTO is a house price predicting model based on machine learning’s linear regression algorithm, Which predicts the price of houses based on their features like BHK, Area, Location and Number of Bathrooms and created with the help of Python and Jupyter. Firstly I had installed some python libraries for this project like Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn and Matplotlib. For this project, I had used a dataset named  ‘Bangaluru_House_Data’  from Kaggle and after loading the dataset we started summarizing, visualizing and cleaning the dataset with the help of Pandas, Numpy and some algorithms. After doing this I started training and testing the dataset with the help of Scikit Learn. At the end the predictions were done. GUI (Graphical User Interface)  was also created to show the outcome with the help of Flask and HTML.
